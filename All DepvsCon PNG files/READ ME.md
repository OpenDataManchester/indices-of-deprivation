**Deprivation vs Political Control in English Local Authorities**

These are a series of visualisations that have been created over a number of years by the team at Open Data Manchester CIC. Most notably Julian Tait and Jamie Whyte.

They are based upon the Index of Multiple Deprivation (IMD) dataset released by UK government for the years 2015, 2019 and 2025.

The data shows the relative deprivation within England at a lower super output area (LSOA) level. The average population of the LSOAs is 1,500 people.

IMD rankings are broken down into 20 buckets (vigintiles). These are then allocated to each local authority and stacked on top of each other.
With most deprived vigintile at the bottom and least at the top. As different LAs would have differing populations, all the LAs have been normalised to fit.

In a way it is a stacked histogram that has been centred.
